## üåü Projects

### LeafScan ‚Äì AI Plant Disease Detection Web App
-	Built a full-stack web application that uses a MobileNetV2-based CNN to detect plant diseases from uploaded leaf images with real-time confidence scoring.
-	Developed the backend using FastAPI and integrated it with a React.js frontend for seamless user interaction.
-	Optimized model inference with TensorFlow and deployed the system for responsive, cross-device access.
-	Designed for use by farmers and researchers to enable early and accurate disease diagnosis.
-	You can see a live demo here : https://leafscan-frontend.vercel.app/

### Teach Room Booking Web Application
- Developed authentication and authorization functionalities using Spring Security with JWT.
- Created RESTful APIs to manage room bookings, user roles, and administrative actions.
- Designed the Dashboard and Booking page using React.

### Task Manager Web App
- Built a full-stack task management application with React.js frontend and Spring Boot backend.
- Implemented JWT authentication for secure user login and authorization.
- Features include task creation, editing, filtering by priority/status, and sorting by due date.

### Superstore Sales Data Analysis
- Utilized Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) and Power BI for data manipulation and visualization, along with PostgreSQL for data storage.
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and anomalies.
- Developed time series analyses to identify seasonal trends and peak sales periods.
